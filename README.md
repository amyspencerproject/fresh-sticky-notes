## Overview

### The challenge
The challenge is to build this app as a greenfield project, use React Hooks, and take the css styling a little further. This app is an update from an app I first built as a lesson from Skillcrush.

## My process
- started with mapping out which components would be container components and presentational components based on what the app should do and where the user data would flow.
- designed the app in Figma [Fresh Sticky Notes](https://www.figma.com/embed?embed_host=share&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.figma.com%2Ffile%2FrOMYTzRhT9IsdPX5sqAYqf%2FFresh-Sticky-Notes-React-Project%3Fnode-id%3D0%253A1%26t%3DCbzTznrTPD52l6Ca-1)

- built out all the JSX in the App.js file first
- considered using Bootstrap for React since I just did a tutorial but after an initial start decided this was more trouble than it was worth for this project
- Had issues with using ``` <picture> ``` element in the JSX so switched to using just an ``` <img> ``` element. Even then I stuggled to get the image file's path correct. I tried importing and naming the image and then using ``` src={image} ``` but this didn't work. Ended up putting the images in the Public folder instead of the src folder. Still not sure how happy I am with my choice but it worked ðŸ˜Š
